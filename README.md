# Space Cargo Loading Optimization Utility
# Introduction

The Space Cargo Loading Optimization Utility is an open-source tool that aims to address the complexities involved in efficiently organizing and managing cargo storage for space missions. Given the increasing number of aerospace companies and the growing need for resupply missions, optimizing the process of loading cargo is essential for operational efficiency.

This utility offers a great first step towards solving the problem of efficiently stowing science payloads based on dimensions, volume, temperature, and orientation constraints. By employing machine learning and optimization algorithms, this tool can help improve cargo storage and inventory planning, paving the way for more efficient space missions.

While the current implementation focuses on solving the problem for specific scenarios, there is ample opportunity for future improvements and features to make the utility even more versatile and efficient.
Features

# The current implementation provides the following features:

    Loading and processing cargo data from CSV files
    Categorizing cargo items based on temperature constraints (below 0Â°C and ambient)
    Implementing the First Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm for cargo placement
    Calculating packing efficiency and comparing it with theoretical maximum efficiency
    Visualizing the efficiency of the FFD algorithm using bar charts

# Future Improvements and Features

There is significant potential to expand this utility with new features and improvements, such as:

    Implementing more advanced packing algorithms for better efficiency
    Incorporating additional constraints, such as orientation, into the optimization process
    Adapting the utility to handle more diverse temperature requirements and other environmental constraints
    Developing a user-friendly interface to simplify data input and result visualization
    Supporting multi-objective optimization to account for trade-offs between cargo placement efficiency, thermal management, and structural integrity
